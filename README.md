# whatgif

GIF-encoding with compression.

Mostly for practice, but also because I want to be able to stitch images together into a *compressed* gif (imageio is great, but
it doesn't compress).

Major ups to Matthew Flickinger's [What's in a GIF?](https://web.archive.org/web/20180813041728/http://www.matthewflickinger.com/lab/whatsinagif/bits_and_bytes.asp).
